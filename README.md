The SQL Pizza Sales Analysis project is designed to delve into the patterns, trends, and insights hidden within a pizza store's sales data. By leveraging SQL's powerful querying capabilities, this project aims to comprehensively understand customer preferences, sales performance, and operational trends that can drive data-driven decision-making.

In this project, you will explore various aspects of the sales data, such as identifying the most popular pizza types, analyzing revenue generation, and uncovering ordering patterns across different times and categories. You will use SQL to extract meaningful information by grouping, aggregating, and joining tables. This analysis will help you understand the store’s sales dynamics, optimise inventory, and tailor marketing strategies to boost profitability.

Key areas of focus in this project include:

Top-Selling and Most Ordered Pizzas: Identifying the most frequently ordered pizzas and determining which types generate the most revenue.
Revenue Analysis: Tracking how revenue accumulates over time, offering insights into sales performance and potential seasonal trends.
Order Patterns and Trends: Analyzing how orders vary by date and time to identify peak hours and average daily sales, which can be critical for staffing and resource allocation.
Category-Wise Analysis: Examining the distribution of orders across different pizza categories, helping to understand customer preferences and adjust the menu offerings accordingly.
